repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr)); areads, gaps (columns)


(rows) - grid-auto-rows: 100px; - all rows will be created implicity

pics that don't fit well into one grid cell so we can make them twice as big or so

use the grid-column: 1/ span 2 (forces to stay in the first column) or auto/ span 2 will be flexible

grid-low will do the same

How to fill the blank spots? ==== 

in the container you can say  grid-auto-flow:dense to fill the blank spaces in the grid


.horizontal
.vertical.
.big


For people having issues with images not fitting into the grid, Per somehow forgets to add that you need to apply the following properties to the img tag

.container > div > img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
}
for it to work well with all the images. Found that through the CSS Grid article he wrote on Medium,.
Hope this helps someone cos I was stuck too
